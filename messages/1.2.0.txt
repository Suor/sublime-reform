New and improved things just got installed:

- new expand_next_word command is basically an improved version of Ctrl+D/Cmd+D.
  Next word matching the one at cursor will be added to selection on each hotkey
  (Alt+D) hit, this respects word boundaries, case, comments and strings.

- select_scope_words (Alt+Shift+D) will select all words in current function
  scope matching the one at cursor. Word boundaries, case, comments and strings
  are respected.

- select_scope_up will now select blocks of comments and line-separated blocks
  and generally became smater. It's now useful for non-code sources too.
  Remember - just hit Ctrl+Shift+; more to select enclosing scopes.

- smart_up and smart_down commands now also visit blocks and were rebinded to
  Alt+[ and Alt+]. Old hotkeys now refer to def_up and def_down commands and
  behave the same.

Reform also got better Python and C# support and other minor enhancements.

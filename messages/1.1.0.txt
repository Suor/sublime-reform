Hey, you just got some Reform improvements:

- select_func command is replaced with select_scope_up,
  which selects enclosing functions and classes on subsequent hits.
- new select_scope_down command to undo last select_scope_up.
- much better support for JavaScript functions for smart move and select commands.
- PHP support to extract_expr command, thanks to Bailey Parker.
